Currently in active development.  Plan is to have the daemon just log temp requests to console for a while to test.

I don't plan on automating the OAuth or Calendar selection, so use listCals to generate a Google API key, and to get the Calendar ID and paste into code.

Default is 80 deg for all time except if there is no event.
