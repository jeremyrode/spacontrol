Currently in active development.  Plan is to have the daemon just log temp requests to console for a while to test.

I don't plan on automating the OAuth or Calendar selection, so to use this one will need to generate a Google API key, and use the listCals to get the Calendar ID and paste into code.

Default is 80 deg for all time except if there is no event, then 83 from 4am-5am
